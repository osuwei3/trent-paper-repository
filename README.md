the file "toronto quarterly data.xlsx" is intended for Assignment 3 of 5250 class
The data set lists rental market data for Toronto from the first quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2023. I will explore the relationship between the total number of apartment rental units rented and the average one-bedroom apartment lease rate (in CAD). These two numbers are enlarged and compared to last year's number, which signals that these are what readers of this report mainly focus on.
